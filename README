This preload library and program implements a cheap way to fake a Linux
program into believing that the clock is set to Something Else.

Usage: datefudge "2003-04-01 09:42" program [args...]

I use this program to find corner cases like "will this program behave
itself on a leap day" or "does this code handle expiry of an SSL
certificate correctly". Manually setting the system clock isn't an
option in many cases, especially on multiuser systems.

This program is not a complete solution. It is not meant to be.
Specifically, it does not touch the times in *stat() results. As a
consequence, programs like "make" will be confused.

DISCLAIMER: Use at your own risk. Please not used this program to disable
restrictions in non-free software (for example, making a "30-day demo"
version run indefinitely).
